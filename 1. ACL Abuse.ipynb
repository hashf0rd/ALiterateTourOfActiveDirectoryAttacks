    "# ACL Overview\n",
    "In the Windows operating system, everything is an object - that is, everything is represented by data structures in memory, that contain members that describe the nature of the data the structure is meant to represent. Obvious things such as files and registry keys are objects, but also more abstract things such as processes and threads are also objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Directory is no different - AD is primarily a database of objects that represent the various identities and relationships in a Windows network. Each object in an AD environment is a user, a group, a computer, a printer, a service account, or even a container for any of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, as in the Windows operating system, Active Directory objects themselves control who has access to them via _Access Control Lists_, or ACLs (specifically the **D**iscretionary **A**ccess **C**ontrol List or DACL), with each Access Control Entry (or ACE) in the ACL specifying an identity and the specific access rights that identity can excise on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access rights are incredibly powerful - the demonstration below is not exhaustive, but it will be become apparent how destructive a misconfiured ACE on the wrong object can be. Notably however, many of the attacks that are enabled by misconfigured access rights are detailed in their own notebooks, making understanding what objects have rights over other objects one of the fundamental tasks in reconaissance, and in understanding numerous other attack paths through an AD environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab however will focus on an attack path that relies entirely on misconfigured ACLs. While this is a contrived example, it will demonstrate how these attacks paths work, and lay important foundations for other labs. If you skip any lab, do not skip this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we will assume we have access to the account of a user called \"John Dee\" by some initial access technique."

The attack path presented here works by making LDAP calls to the directory service in order to both query the directory and request modifications to data in the directory. We are using the [ADSI interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/using-adsi) for these calls.\n",

The `DirectoryEntry` object being constructed above is binding to the _RootDSE_, which is the Root object of the entire directory. The RootDSE sits on a directory server, so we supply it wih the FQDN of the domain controller (the directory server for this lab). The `DirecotryEntry` object is also constructed [using parameters for an authenticated bind](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.directoryentry.-ctor?view=net-8.0#system-directoryservices-directoryentry-ctor(system-string-system-string-system-string-system-directoryservices-authenticationtypes)), using the credentials of the account we have compromised.\n",

We need to add a mask for certain propertes - while the DACL is viewable by all users who can view an object, the SACL is only viewable by domain admins. We add a mask to only return the DACL portion of the object security descriptor, otherwise the security descriptor would be blank (with no DACL either). Finally, we apply an [LDAP filter to the DirectorySearcher]() and either return a single result, or all possible results.\n",

    "You will notice in the above code and in nearly all other code cells in this lab that there are calls to the `.Dipose()` method after nearly all operations involving construction of a `DirectoryEntry`. This is because ADSI caches connections unless they are explicitly broken by disposing of the resources it uses, and a `DirectoryEntry` is a direct bind and therefore connection to an object in a directory service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasona to explicitly break this connection are twofold; for one, we use the DirectoryEntry constructor to create an _authenticated_ bind using our stolen creds, so that we can begin searching the directory as a normal user rather than an anonymous user. This means any time we want to re-authenticate we need to dispose this initial bind. The second reason, is that after we have achieved privileged esclataion, such as adding our compromised user to select privileged groups, we need to re-authenticate so that our access token associated with the ADSI bind is reconstructed with the newly added privileges. If we did not explicitly break the bind with `.Dispose()`, the connection would persist (you can check this by removing the `.Dipose()` and examing the network traffic) and we would continue to use the older access token which lacks the newly added privileged groups, and subsequent attempts to escalate privileges would fail. There is a potential opsec consideration here - as these repeated authentication attempts will possibly appear abnormal when compared to normal user behaviour. Again, **this notebook is meant to be illustrative not prescriptive** - it is written to demonstrate what _can_ be done, not what _should_ be done. "
